# Tukstantis
#
# The goal of the game is to collect 1000 points.
# 
# The goal is achieved by collecting poker cards that each have an assigned value:
# - The A is 11 points
# - 10 is 10 points
# - The K is 4 points
# - The Q is 3 points
# - The J is 2 points
# - The 9 is 0 points
#  
# The cards are collected in rounds. Each round, 3 players are handed 7 cards, and 3
# leftover cards are left in the center of the table. The round begins with a bidding
# war, where each player bids how many points they can gather within the round.
# The bidding war starts at 100 (this may raise questions that will be elaborated on later).
#
# After the bidding phase, the player who bid the most receives the cards in the center
# and sorts out 3 cards that they do not need. Then, they begin by laying their first card.
# 
# The first card being laid per turn is the base card of the turn. The goal of the other players
# is to beat it by laying a more valuable card of the same type. If they do not have a card
# that is more valuable of the same type, they have to give away a card from their hand of the
# same type. If they do not have a card of the same type in their hand, they have to give up any 
# other card.
# 
# This way, the largest amount of points that could be collected would be 120:
# 11*4 + 10*4 + 4*4 + 3*4 + 2*4 = 120. So how come does the bidding war start at 100? The catch is: 
# a pair of a king and a queen of the same type (further - royal couple) also has a value if placed on the board:
# - Spades - 40
# - Clubs - 60
# - Diamonds - 80
# - Hearts - 100
# If one half of the royal couple is placed on the board (and called), the sum of all collected cards + the 
# value of the royal couple (or couples, if you are lucky) determine how many points you
# gathered. If you did not manage to gather the points you bid however, the bid is subtracted 
# from your current score (which can go into the negatives). If other players manage to snatch
# cards away from you, they get the points for their collected cards, and may also call their
# royal couple.
# 
# When a royal couple is called, all the cards of the same type become trump cards which can
# beat any card that is not of the same type (the trump card hierarchy remains the same). So 
# think carefully about calling your royal couples!
# 
# If you like to play risky and more fun - bids can be made without looking at your cards. This
# way, you can earn twice the points that you bid if you manage gather them. You opponents will
# also gain double the points that they gather, and if you do not manage to gather the points
# that you bid, you lose double the points.
# 
# The game finalizes once one player climbs over 1000 points. However, if a player reaches 900
# points, they have three rounds to win a bid. If they fail to do so, 100 points are deducted
# from their result. Additionally, players who reach 900 points do not gain any points from
# rounds during which other players won the bid.
# 
# Now, feel free to try the game out yourself! There might be rules that I have missed, please
# point it out.
