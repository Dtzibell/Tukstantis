Goal
---
The game can only be played by 3 players. The goal is to collect 1000 points faster
than your opponents.

The goal is achieved by collecting poker cards that each have an assigned value:
- The A is 11 points
- 10 is 10 points
- The K is 4 points
- The Q is 3 points
- The J is 2 points
- The 9 is 0 points
This makes a total of 24 cards.

Course of the game
---
The cards are collected in rounds. Each round, the players are handed 7 cards, and 3
leftover cards are placed in the center of the table. The round begins with a bidding
war, where each player bids how many points they can collect within the round.
The bidding war starts at 100 (this may raise questions that will be elaborated on later).

After the bidding phase, the player who bid the most receives the cards in the center
and has to remove 3 cards from their hand (including the 3 cards just received).
Then, they begin the round by laying their first card.

The first card being laid per turn is the base card of the turn. The goal of the 
other players is to beat it by laying a more valuable card of the same type. If
they do not have a card that is more valuable of the same type, they have to give 
away a card from their hand of the same type. If they do not have a card of the 
same type in their hand, they have to give up another card. At the end of the 
round, the points the players could collect are counted. If the winner of the bid
reaced the amount of points they bid on, the bid amount is added to their point
account. If they do not, it is subtracted. Other players receive the amount
of points they collected, rounded to the nearest 10.

Royal couples
---

Considering the course of the game just described, the largest amount of points
that could be collected would be 120: 11*4 + 10*4 + 4*4 + 3*4 + 2*4 = 120. That 
would make the bidding war starting at 100 boring. The catch is: a pair of a king
and a queen of the same type (further - royal couple) also has a value if placed
on the board:
- Spades - 40
- Clubs - 60
- Diamonds - 80
- Hearts - 100
If one half of the royal couple is placed on the board as the base card 
(further - called), the sum of all collected cards + the value of the royal couple
(or couples, if you are lucky) determine how many points you collected. Players
that did not win the bid may also call royal couples.

When a royal couple is called, all the cards of the same type become trump cards which can
beat any card that is not of the same type (the trump card hierarchy remains the same). So 
think carefully about calling your royal couples!

Gambling element
---

Gamblig addicts listen up - bids can be made without looking at your cards. This
way, you can earn twice the points that you bid if you manage to collect them. You opponents will
also gain double the points that they collect, and if you do not manage to collect the points
that you bid, you lose double the points.

End of the game
---
The game finalizes once one player climbs over 1000 points. However, if a player reaches 900
points, they have three rounds to win a bid. If they fail to do so, 100 points are deducted
from their result. Additionally, players who reach 900 points do not gain any points from
rounds during which other players won the bid.
